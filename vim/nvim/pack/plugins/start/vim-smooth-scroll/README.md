# vim-smooth-scroll

This plugin overwrites CTRL-f, CTRL-b, CTRL-d, CTRL-u, zt, zz, and zb with code that scrolls the lines fluidly to help the user know how far they are scrolling in the file.  Plus it's good looking.

## Installation

This is a [Pathogen] compatible plugin.  It requires no configuration, though it can be [tuned].

## Developer Notes

This plugin was forked from [terryma/vim-smooth-scroll](https://github.com/terryma/vim-smooth-scroll) which does not support zt, zz, or zb.
